# URL-SHORTENER

Developed an enterprise Java web application using Spring MVC Framework. Used Springâ€™s JDBC Template to access data in HSQLDB. 
The project includes a signup page where users can create an account with username and password. After the user is logged in, a private page is displayed where users can submit a Long URL and get back a shortened URL. Also, on the same private page, they can view a list of URLs they have shortened and the number of clicks each shortened URL has received. The application also includes a public front page where users can input a shortened URL and view the original URL without following the link. When we
click on the shortened URL, the clicks are recorded before redirecting to the original URL.
